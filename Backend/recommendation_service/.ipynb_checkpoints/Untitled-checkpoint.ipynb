By automating processes that are highly manual, repetitive and rules-based, RPA solutions can yield greater productivity, create efficiency and reduce costs. Common internal processes across industries (such as banking, retail, tech and the government) that can benefit from RPA include HR, IT services, supply chain, finance and accounting, and customer management.\\n\\nThe programme aims to introduce robotics process automation to participants, and impart basic proficiency in RPA tools so that they are able to design their own RPA bots to automate common work processes in their organisations, upon completion of the course.\",\n",
